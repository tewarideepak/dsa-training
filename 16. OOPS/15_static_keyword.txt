🔹 static Keyword in C++ – OOP Notes

The static keyword in C++ has multiple meanings depending on its context. In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it's often used for class-level data or functions.
🔸 1. Static Data Members (Class Variables)

    Shared across all objects of the class.

    Only one copy exists in memory, regardless of the number of objects.

class Counter {
public:
    static int count;
    Counter() { count++; }
};

int Counter::count = 0; // Definition outside the class

✅ Use Case: Tracking how many objects of a class have been created.

🔸 2. Static Member Functions

    Can be called without creating an object.

    Can only access static members (data/functions).

    Does not have access to this pointer.

class Math {
public:
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

// Usage
int result = Math::add(3, 4);

🔸 3. Static Inside Functions (Local Static Variables)

    Initialized only once, retains its value between function calls.

    Useful for caching or tracking inside a function.

void callCount() {
    static int count = 0;
    count++;
    cout << "Called " << count << " times\n";
}

🔸 4. Static Global Variables or Functions (File Scope)

    If declared at file-level, it limits the visibility to that file (compilation unit).

    Used in modular programming to avoid naming conflicts.

static int fileLevelVariable = 5; // only accessible in this file

✅ Summary Table

| Context                    | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static data member         | Shared across all objects of a class                              |
| Static member function     | Belongs to the class, not to any object                           |
| Static local variable      | Retains value between function calls                              |
| Static global (file scope) | Limits visibility of variable/function to the current source file |


🔁 Example: Static in OOP Context

class Student {
    static int total_students;
public:
    Student() { total_students++; }

    static int getStudentCount() {
        return total_students;
    }
};

int Student::total_students = 0;

✅ Usage:

Student s1, s2;
cout << Student::getStudentCount();  // Output: 2
