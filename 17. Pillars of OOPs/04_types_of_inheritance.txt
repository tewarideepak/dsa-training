🧬 Types of Inheritance in C++ – OOP Notes

Inheritance allows one class (derived) to acquire properties and behavior from another class (base). C++ supports multiple types of inheritance.
✅ 1. Single Inheritance

    One derived class inherits from one base class.

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() { cout << "Eating\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() { cout << "Barking\n"; }
};

✅ 2. Multiple Inheritance

    One derived class inherits from more than one base class.

class Engine {
public:
    void start() { cout << "Engine starts\n"; }
};

class Wheels {
public:
    void rotate() { cout << "Wheels rotate\n"; }
};

class Car : public Engine, public Wheels {};

🟨 Caution: Can lead to ambiguity if both base classes have members with the same name.
✅ 3. Multilevel Inheritance

    A class is derived from another derived class.

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {}
};

class Mammal : public Animal {
public:
    void walk() {}
};

class Human : public Mammal {
public:
    void think() {}
};

✅ 4. Hierarchical Inheritance

    Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.

class Shape {
public:
    void draw() {}
};

class Circle : public Shape {};
class Rectangle : public Shape {};

✅ 5. Hybrid Inheritance

    A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

// Multiple + Hierarchical → Hybrid
class A {
public:
    void show() {}
};

class B : public A {};
class C : public A {};

class D : public B, public C {};  // ⚠️ Ambiguity arises!

🛠️ Solution: Use virtual inheritance to avoid ambiguity (diamond problem).

class A {
public:
    void show() {}
};

class B : virtual public A {};
class C : virtual public A {};
class D : public B, public C {};

📊 Summary Table

| Type         | Description                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Single       | One base → one derived         |
| Multiple     | Multiple bases → one derived   |
| Multilevel   | Inheritance in chain           |
| Hierarchical | One base → multiple derived    |
| Hybrid       | Combination (may need virtual) |
